## 📖 About PAKU

[cite\_start]**PAKU** (Personalized Autonomous Knowledge Unit) is a cutting-edge AI system designed to create a comprehensive digital clone of a user—replicating voice, face, and decision-making patterns[cite: 31]. [cite\_start]Unlike traditional cloud-based assistants, PAKU is engineered with a **privacy-first architecture**, ensuring all sensitive operations like OCR, semantic analysis, and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) occur locally or via distributed inference on personal devices[cite: 32].

The current frontend interface, **EduAssist Pro**[cite\_start], serves as the command center for educators, automating administrative workflows such as grading, scheduling, and student interaction without compromising data sovereignty[cite: 148].

### 🌟 Unique Selling Points (USPs)

  - [cite\_start]**🛡️ 100% Privacy-First:** Eliminates reliance on external cloud servers for processing sensitive academic data (student records, exam papers)[cite: 33].
  - [cite\_start]**⚡ Distributed Inference:** Dynamically offloads heavy compute tasks (like LLM inference) from mobile devices to laptops via local networks to reduce latency[cite: 36].
  - [cite\_start]**🧠 Contextual Memory:** Uses RAG with Knowledge Graphs to recall past interactions and academic context for personalized responses[cite: 34].
  - [cite\_start]**🎓 Teacher-Centric Tools:** Specialized modules for auto-grading lab manuals, checking assignments, and managing academic calendars[cite: 170].

## ✨ Features

### 🛠️ Core Modules

#### 🤖 Auto-Lab Grader Pro

  * **Comparative Analysis:** Automatically compares student submissions against an "Ideal Solution" file.
  * [cite\_start]**Semantic Scoring:** Intelligently grades objective and practical components based on logic rather than just keyword matching[cite: 2062].
  * **Export to Sheets:** Generates detailed spreadsheets of class performance with a single click.

#### 📝 Assignment AI Checker

  * **Text Analysis Engine:** Upload question papers to establish context, then bulk-process student submissions for semantic accuracy.
  * **Smart Penalty System:** Automatically calculates and applies penalties for late submissions based on configurable deadlines.
  * **Handwriting OCR:** (Prototype) Capable of reading and digitizing handwritten assignments for grading.

#### 📅 Intelligent Calendar

  * **Google Workspace Sync:** Two-way synchronization with Google Calendar to manage academic schedules.
  * **Conflict Detection:** AI Assistant warns about scheduling conflicts and suggests "Deep Work" sessions or breaks based on workload.
  * **Smart Agenda:** Visualizes daily classes, meetings, and deadlines in an intuitive timeline view.

#### 🗣️ Multimodal Meeting Clone (Prototype)

  * **Virtual Avatar:** Generates a real-time lip-synced video avatar to represent the user in meetings.
  * [cite\_start]**Command Interface:** Accepts text commands to drive the avatar's speech and actions during live feeds[cite: 2089].
